# Neurphys

Neurphys (pronounced "nervous") is an IO and analysis package built to streamline and standardize the data handling, analysis, and visualization of electrophysiology and calcium imaging data for the members of the [Surmeier lab](http://physio.northwestern.edu/).


## Dependencies

- [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [scipy](http://www.scipy.org/)
- [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [neo](https://pythonhosted.org/neo/)


## Installation

First, download [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) which will come with
most required libraries including `numpy`, `pandas`, `scipy`. 
Then download or clone the repository using `git` as follows,

```bash
git clone https://github.com/surmeierlab/neurphys
```

You can download dependencies which we provide in `requirements.txt`. Use `pip` to install 
the rest of dependencies i.e.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For now, you have to add the package into python environment by adding path to `.bash_profile` or 
`.bashrc` in order to import and use `neurphys` library.

```python
export PYTHONPATH='/PATH/TO/neurphys:$PYTHONPATH'
export PYTHONPATH
```


## Usage

```python
import neurphys as nu
```
